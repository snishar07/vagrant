# vagrant

We downloaded the vagrant software and confirmed the download on Gitbash. We initialized Vagrant and made configuration changes in the Vagrant file to create a VM. We then configurent the Vagrant file to install apache2 and update it after install. We were then able to see the homepage for apache on the browser.  We deployed multimachine using vagrant and accessed it via ssh. We then finally pushed the Vagrantfile to github and created a README file describing the project.
